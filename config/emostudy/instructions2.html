While watching the movie, we want you to mark down the times at which you feel a change in your emotional response.<br>
<br>
These points in the movie may occur when there is a major change in topic, location, time, etc., but they do not have to. 
Whenever you personally feel your emotions change (not the emotion of the charters), you will use the keyboard to mark
the time as well as the type of emotion.<br>
<br>
Each emotion should be between 10 seconds and 3Â minutes long.
