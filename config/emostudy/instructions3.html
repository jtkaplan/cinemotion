Below the movie, you will see six buttons, each with an emotional label and a corresponding keyboard button.<br>
<br>
<?php include('buttons_module.php'); ?>
We want you to press the corresponding key every time you feel an emotion coming on, as quickly as you notice it, and the again whenever you feel the emotion has gone away.
<br><br>
You are free to indicate a change as many times as you would like throughout the movie and keep more than one button on at time. <br><br>
Keep in mind, however, that an emotion is unlikely to last less than 10s or more than 3 minutes. <br>
